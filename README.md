# hello-world
practice repository

Hi,
My name is Sarbajit, and this is just a random file that github told me to create. I suck at typing, making mistakes along the way I type and coming back to rectify them. Taking a lot of time actually. Also I like learning to code and spent a considerable amount of time in it.

That's it.
Next time folks.
